| Link Type | URL |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Practical Link** | **[pagecast.romelium.cc](https://pagecast.romelium.cc)** |
| **Dogfooding Link** | **[Hosted by Itself](https://gist.githack.com/Romelium/7513fc74536c3be15edf769cc416d10f/raw/4cebb56717ae4637de404039918637526e5f2345/index.html)** _(Yes, this link was generated by the app itself)_ |

## What's the deal with this?

Ever just need to share a quick HTML prototype, a code snippet, or a single-page app without setting up a whole project or deploying to a hosting service? This is for that.

It's a self-contained tool that lets you paste your code, see it update live, and then generate a permanent, shareable link using a GitHub Gist.

-   **See your code update live.** No refresh needed.
-   **Get a permanent link with one click.** Perfect for sharing quick apps.
-   **It's just one HTML file.** Save it, use it offline, keep it on a flash drive.
-   **Works on your phone, too.** The layout is responsive.

## How to Use It

1.  **Get a GitHub Token.**
    -   Go to [**GitHub's token creation page**](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=gist&description=Page%20Cast%20App).
    -   You only need the **`gist`** scope. Nothing else.
    -   Copy the generated token (`ghp_...`).

2.  **Paste the token into the app.**
    -   It's saved in your browser's local storage, so you only have to do this once.

3.  **Paste your HTML code.**
    -   The preview on the right will update as you type.

4.  **Click the "Cast Page" button.**
    -   Your permanent link will appear below, ready to be copied and shared.

## Saving It for Later

This whole thing is a single `.html` file. Just right-click and "Save Page As..." to keep a copy on your computer. It works completely offline (until you need to cast, of course).

## Acknowledgements

This tool relies entirely on the excellent [rawgithack](https://github.com/neoascetic/rawgithack) service by [neoascetic](https://github.com/neoascetic) to serve the Gist content. It's the magic that makes the permanent links work.
